# Create a Project 

Once your session starts, SWAN will first show the **Projects** view. A _Project_ in SWAN is a special type of folder that you can use as a container for your work on a given topic: notebooks, input/output files, other subfolders, etc. As will be explained later in this help panel, a project is also the unit of sharing in SWAN: you can share a project with your colleagues and thus provide them with everything they need to run the notebooks you created.

From the Projects tab, you can create a folder by clicking on the **`+`** button. You will be then asked a name for the project and, if you do not provide it, a default one will be chosen.

Once the project is successfully created, you will be automatically redirected inside it so that you can start adding content to it.

## Create a Project from git

SWAN also allows you to create a _Project_ from a git repository. If the repository happens to have a "Open in SWAN" button, you just need to click it and all the contents will be copied to your Projects view.

You can also click the "Download Project from git" button, and enter the path to the repository (use the same link used to clone, with the .git extension). For security reasons, only projects stored in Github and CERN Gitlab are allowed.
