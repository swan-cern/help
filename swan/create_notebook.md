# Create a Notebook

Notebooks are documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. You can even run the code 
to produce rich interactive content, like plots and graphics.

SWAN supports code written in Python (2 or 3, depending on the software stack chosen), ROOT C++, R and Octave. To know 
more, please [read about Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), the interface used by SWAN to provide this functionalities.

To create a notebook, click the "+" button in the file view, when inside a Project or folder. You will then be able to
choose the language you want.

If you are inside the Projects view, create a Project first.

If you want to see your running notebooks or terminals, click the "Running Processes" button, inside the options menu ("∙∙∙"), 
on the top right.
