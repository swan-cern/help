# Synchronize data from your computer

CERNBox provides a [sync client](http://cernbox.web.cern.ch/cernbox/en/synchronisation/) for the majority of platforms (including mobile). If you install it, any file you add to your local CERNBox folder will be automatically synchronized and therefore visible from SWAN as well. The communication also works in the other direction: any file (for instance, a notebook) that you produce in SWAN will be available in your local CERNBox. This way, you can combine your work in the cloud with SWAN with local work on your computer, if you wish so.

If you want to exercise the aforementioned feature, you can find a set of examples [here](https://github.com/dpiparo/swanExamples) that you can clone in your local CERNBox so that they become available to SWAN as well!

Additionally, the SWAN interface has an option for you to upload files: in the files view, there is an upload button on the top right.
