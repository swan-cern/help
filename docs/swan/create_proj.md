# Create a Project 

Once your session starts, SWAN will first show the **Projects** view. A _Project_ in SWAN is a special type of folder that you can use as a container for your work on a given topic: notebooks, input/output files, other subfolders, etc. As will be explained later in this help panel, a project is also the unit of sharing in SWAN: you can share a project with your colleagues and thus provide them with everything they need to run the notebooks you created.

From the Projects tab, you can create a folder by clicking on the **`+`** button. You will be then asked a name for the project and, if you do not provide it, a default one will be chosen.

Once the project is successfully created, you will be automatically redirected inside it so that you can start adding content to it.

### Create a Project from git

SWAN also allows you to create a Project from a git repository. In the Projects view, you can click the **`Download Project from git`** button and enter the path to the repository. Please note that you need to append _.git_ to the URL of the repository. For security reasons, only repositories in Github and CERN Gitlab are allowed.
 
Alternatively, if the git repository has an **`Open in SWAN`** button, you just need to click it and its contents will be copied into a new Project.
