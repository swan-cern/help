# Open a Terminal

From a SWAN session, you can also open a _terminal_ in your web browser. To do so, click on the terminal button (**`>_`**) on the top right and a terminal will open in another tab. This is a full-featured terminal, just like a local one.

The initial directory of a terminal is your home directory in SWAN: CERNBox.

Any terminal you create in a session will have access to all the packages of the LCG release you selected for that session. Moreover, terminals also see the additional configuration defined in a user environment script, if any.

You can have multiple terminals open at the same time. If you want to see your running terminals, click on **`Running Processes`** inside the options menu (**`∙∙∙`**) on the top right.
