# Introduction

As part of a joint project — called "SWAN on the TN" — between the ATS and IT departments at CERN, a specialized SWAN instance is being developed to meet the specific needs of the ATS sector. A prototype of this ATS SWAN is already available for testing at:

<https://swan-acc-qa.cern.ch>

This documentation outlines its main user-facing features:

- [Custom sofware environments](custom_envs.md): create software environments based on an Acc-Py release when launching a SWAN session.
- [URLs with arguments](url_args.md): generate URLs that pre-configure user sessions (e.g., software stack, memory allocation, etc.).

!!! note
    The new ATS SWAN will enable users to create sessions exposed to the TN. However, this functionality is not yet available in the current prototype.
