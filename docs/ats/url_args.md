# URLs with arguments

In the SWAN ATS prototype, users can generate URLs that reflect a specific configuration of the SWAN form. The form now includes a new **Generate URL** button. When clicked, it copies a URL to the clipboard that encodes all the currently selected options in the form.

These URLs with arguments simplify the process of consistently starting a SWAN session with a predefined setup or sharing a specific configuration with other users.

!!! note
    When opening a URL with arguments, SWAN displays the standard configuration form pre-filled with the provided settings. The user must then confirm that they want to start a session using that configuration.
