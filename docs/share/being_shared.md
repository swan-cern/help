# Check what you share

When opening the **Share** view (by clicking on the **`Share`** tab), you will see two lists:
- The projects others have shared with you (**`Shared with me`**).
- The projects you have shared with others (**`Shared by me`**).

In the second list, you will be able to edit the people you share your projects with, or even stop sharing. Just hover over the project name and the **`Edit sharing`** button will appear, which will lead you to the Sharing Panel.
