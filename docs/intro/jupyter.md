# Jupyter notebooks

The Jupyter notebook is an open-source web application that allows to create, execute and share documents containing code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning and much more.

The SWAN interface is built on top of Jupyter, allowing users to write and run notebooks by only using their web browser. SWAN users can create notebooks in four different languages: Python (2 and 3), C++, R and Octave.
