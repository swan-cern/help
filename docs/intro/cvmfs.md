# Software: CVMFS

[CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem) (CernVM File System) is CERN's software distribution service. It was developed to assist High-Energy Physics (HEP) collaborations to deploy software on the computing infrastructure used to run data processing applications.

SWAN uses CVMFS to access collections of software, called LCG releases. An LCG Release is a set of several (~200) software packages consistently built together. When a user logs into SWAN, they can select a particular LCG release and their software environment is configured accordingly.

If you want to know what packages, and corresponding versions, are available in each release, please check the
