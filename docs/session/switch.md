# Switch to a new configuration

Did you select the option to always start the same configuration but now you need a different one?
<br>Do you want to restart your session and/or select a new configuration?

To do these, you can go to the top right menu, click on the **`...`** button and select **`Change configuration`**. This will terminate your session and take you back to the configuration form. Please note that this action will also invalidate any default configuration you had saved.
