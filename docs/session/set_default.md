# Set a configuration as default

If there is a configuration that you normally use, you do not have to select it every time you start a session. Instead, you can tick the **`Always start with this configuration`** check box that is located at the bottom of the configuration form. This way, the next time you start a session SWAN will automatically load your preferred configuration.
