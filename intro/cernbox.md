# Cloud storage: CERNBox and EOS

### CERNBox

[CERNBox](https://cernbox.cern.ch) is the CERN service to store, share and synchronise data across multiple devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops,
desktops) and multiple users. Everyone with a standard CERN computing account has access to it.

In SWAN we use it to provide the user storage space and sharing functionalities. To start a session, you need 
to active your CERNBox account first. To do it, [access this page](https://cernbox.cern.ch).

You will then be able to see all your files inside the SWAN interface. All your projects and notebooks will be saved here.

### EOS

[EOS](http://eos.web.cern.ch/) is CERN mass storage system, used by CERNBox. It is also the place were many of the LHC experiments are stored.
SWAN gives access to EOS, and all of its data, without the need of extra configuration.
