# Check what others share with you

The **Share** view (accessible by clicking on the **`Share`** tab) also allows you to manage the projects that others have shared with you.

In the list **`Projects shared with me`**, you will see all the Projects that someone shared with you, including their names,  size, name of the person that shared them, and when they were shared.

By hovering over those projects, you will see a **`Clone`** button appearing. If you click it, you will be asked for the name you want to give to the project and, by hitting **`Clone`** again to confirm, the contents of the project will be copied into your CERNBox.

Please note that the contents of your new project are a copy of the original ones. This is due to the fact that Jupyter does not currently support concurrent editing of the same notebook file by multiple users.

But, if you just want to see what's inside a Project before cloning, you can click on its name. Its files will then be displayed and you will be able to open them. Just keep in mind that you're only going to see the files in _reading_ mode. If you want to edit then, you still need to clone them.
