# Check what others share with you/Clone

When opening the Share view (clicking on the "Share" tab), you will see a list with the projects you have shared and 
those that others shared with you.

Currently it's not possible to open projects shared with you to check its contents (this functionality will be added in the next update): you will need to copy them to your CERNBox.
To do this, hover the list with the mouse to see the "Clone" buttons and click the button of the Project you want to copy.
After choosing the name you want the Project to be called, if everything was ok, you will be redirected automatically inside it.

Only sharing by copy is supported because Jupyter does not support yet the concurrent editing of 
the same notebook file by multiple people.
